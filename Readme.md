# COVID19
On 31st January 2020, the Italian Council of Ministers declared the state of emergency as a result of the health risk associated with Covid19.

Here I show a map reporting the percentage of population affected by province starting from 2nd of February 2020.

To generate the map I used the following data:

- Covid19 data published by the Italian government, https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19 (specifically my analysis exploits the data in https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/blob/master/dati-province/dpc-covid19-ita-province.csv)
- The shapefile of the Italian administrative boundaries (https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/222527)
- Italian demographic data (http://dati.istat.it/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=DCIS_POPRES1).
